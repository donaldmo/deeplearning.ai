    You should express what you want a model to do by \ 
    providing instructions that are as clear and \ 
    specific as you can possibly make them. \ 
    This will guide the model towards the desired output, \ 
    and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant \ 
    or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a \ 
    clear prompt with writing a short prompt. \ 
    In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity \ 
    and context for the model, which can lead to \ 
    more detailed and relevant outputs.

    grab a cup and put a tea bag in it. Once the water is \

    few minutes, take out the tea bag. If you \
