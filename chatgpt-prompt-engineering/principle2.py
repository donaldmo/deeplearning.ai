In this lesson you'll proactice two pompting principles and

    Your task is to determine if the student's solution \

    To solve the problem do the following:
    - First, work out your own solution to the problem including the final total. 
    - Then compare your solution to the student's solution \ 
    and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not. 
    Don't decide if the student's solution is correct until 
    you have done the problem yourself.

    Use the following format:
    Question:
    ```

    ```
    student's solution here
